- 👋 Hi, I’m Jirka
- 👀 I'm mainly interested in .NET, but I'd love to learn other areas of software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything which gives me some experience in development. So if anybody needs help and is willing to introduce me into the field, do not hesitate to contact me.
- My current position is Junior Software Engineer at YSoft, where my goal is to become an experienced and reliable software developer.
