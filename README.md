- 👋 Hi, I’m Jirka
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET
- 🌱 I’m just learning .NET technologies in general. I build desktop applications in WPF and WinForms (older ones) in my work, but I'm interested in everything around development. I'm currently getting into the Blazor to be able to build web applications and also getting familiar with SQL relational databases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything which gives me some experience in development. So if anybody needs help and is willing to introduce me into the field, do not hesitate to contact me.
- My job position now is Consultant CAM, but since I started to develop extension CATIA applications in .NET, I'm interested only in development and CAM consulting part of my job is more like obligation. 
- 📫 You can contact me on my email jiri.mancl@icloud.com or via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiri-mancl-23804a144/
