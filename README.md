- 👋 Hi, I’m @JirkaMan
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET
- 🌱 I’m just learning .NET technologies in general. I build desktop applications in WPF and (older ones) in WinForms in my work, but I'm currently getting into Blazor to be able to build also web applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything which gives me some experience in development. So if anybody needs help and is willing to introduce me into the field, do not hesitate to contact me.
- My job position now is Consultant CAM, but since I started to develop extension CATIA applications in .NET, I'm interested only in development and CAM consulting part of my job is more like obligation. 
- 📫 You can contact me via my email jirimancl@gmail.com or via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiri-mancl-23804a144/
